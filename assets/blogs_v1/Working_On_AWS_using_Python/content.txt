AWS provided its own SDK for python to do operations on AWS services through script.

The python packages are boto3 and botocore.

boto3 is the official AWS SDK tool kit for python to call AWS APIs while botocore is the underlying
foundation and technically an abstracted model.

To create a boto3 client,

import boto3

client = boto3.client(<service_name>, aws_access_key_id="", aws_secret_access_key="", region_name="")

For the service to call, refer the boto3 documentation https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html

And don't use the credentials like above in product. You can have it for any test scripts. Consider using
credential saving in config file under .aws directory

From the client, all the applicable API calls can be made to that service. Creating s3, ec2 and pretty much everything ..

Will write more on this on further blogs...
