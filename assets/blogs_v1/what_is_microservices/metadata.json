This one of other major issue in monolythic architecture.\n\nTo overcome this,\n\nLets split those into mulitple loosly coupled services.\n\nUser Management System\nData Management System\nReports Manager\nContent Sharing Manager\nCommunication Manager\nPayment Service\nNotification Service\n\nI named above just for this blog. Imagine the names and amount of services will be for an pro product. All the services\nhave its own database. APIs will be exposed in all services so that UI can communicate with any service. Suppose, the\nNotification Service requires data from Data Management System, it can call the internal APIs to process data.\n\nWe can add encryption to make this more securable.\n\n",
