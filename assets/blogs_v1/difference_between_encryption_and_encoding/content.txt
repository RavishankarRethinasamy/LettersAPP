ENCODING:

Encoding is a process of converting one form into another form. Which is easily reversible.

Let's assume you are reading a book for your grandma. The book has the contents in text format. when u read ,You are
converting it as sound so grandma can understand what you are reading. The use of encoding is to convert data so that
it can be consumed by a different type of system.

in technichal we do lot of encoding.Ex: ASCII , Base64 ..
Encoding does not protect or secure data because it is easy to reverse.


ENCRYPTION:

Encryption is process of changing data to conceal the content so that unauthorized person cannot understand.
Technically, it is the process of converting readable plaintext to incomprehensible text.

encryption involves cryptographic alogorithm and encryption key , so any one who knows the alogorithm and key can
decrypt the data and understand. The actual purpose of encryption is data security and integrity.


Encryption and Encoding both are used in Software data security.

In conputers Encryption always deals with the Binary (0s and 1s) . So when we want to Encrypt a text ,
we may need to Encode it into bytes(Binary) , then we do the encryption on the bytes So we get the encrypted bytes ,
then we do encode the encrypted bytes so that it can be shared through any medium.
