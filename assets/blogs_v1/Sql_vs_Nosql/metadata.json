      "value": "SQL stands for structured query language\n\nNo sql ofcourse No to SQL\n\nSQL is restrictive which requires predefined schema for the structured data while NO sql has\ndynamic schema for unstructured data.\n\nIn SQL, data stored in table format, rows and columns while in NO Sql data stored in many forms\nlike Key value pair, document-oriented, graph-based etc.\n\nSQL in vertically scalable while No sql is horizontally scalable. What does the even mean ?\n\nIn vertical, if the load is increasing, we can increase RAM, CPU, SSD and other things in the\ndatabase server to support that load.\n\nIn Horizontal, in addition to increasing RAM, CPUs in the server we can create more servers and make\nit usable. That concept is called replica set. Which is why No sql became powerful and suitable choice\nfor large or constantly changing data sets.\n\nSQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) while the NoSQL\ndatabase follows the Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance).\n\nSome SQL databases are Mysql, Oracle, MSSQL etc..\nSome NO Sql databases are MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis etc..",
