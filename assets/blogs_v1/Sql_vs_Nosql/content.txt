SQL stands for structured query language

No sql ofcourse No to SQL

SQL is restrictive which requires predefined schema for the structured data while NO sql has
dynamic schema for unstructured data.

In SQL, data stored in table format, rows and columns while in NO Sql data stored in many forms
like Key value pair, document-oriented, graph-based etc.

SQL in vertically scalable while No sql is horizontally scalable. What does the even mean ?

In vertical, if the load is increasing, we can increase RAM, CPU, SSD and other things in the
database server to support that load.

In Horizontal, in addition to increasing RAM, CPUs in the server we can create more servers and make
it usable. That concept is called replica set. Which is why No sql became powerful and suitable choice
for large or constantly changing data sets.

SQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) while the NoSQL
database follows the Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance).

Some SQL databases are Mysql, Oracle, MSSQL etc..
Some NO Sql databases are MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis etc..
